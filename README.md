<h2>☑️ What is this app about?</h2>
<p>Flash Chat is an internet based messaging app similar to WhatsApp, the popular messaging app that was bought by Facebook for $22 billion. I have used a service called Firebase Firestore as a backend database to store and retrieve messages from the cloud.</p>
<h2>☑️ Goal</h2>
<p>One of the most fundamental component of modern iOS apps is the Table View. Table Views are used everywhere from the Mail app to the Messages app. It’s a crucial part of every iOS developer’s tool belt. In this app I have been getting to grips with Table Views, created custom cells, and made my own cloud-based backend database.</p>
